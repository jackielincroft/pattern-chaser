            <li class="text-secondary lead">Set your <strong>preferences</strong> for what kind of patterns you're open to â€“ your preferred craft, yarn weight, yardage, etc.  You can make as many or as few restrictions as you'd like, although we recommend restricting 2-3 things.</li>
            <li class="text-warning lead">Next, you'll be shown a series of random patterns that fit your preferences.  For each pattern, <strong>vote</strong> on whether or not you like the pattern.  This data is what our algorithm will use to find your perfect pattern recommendations!</li>
            <li class="text-info lead">Finally, wait for a moment while we find your pattern <strong>results</strong> we think you'll love!  Each pattern will be linked to it's corresponding Ravelry page for more information.  Feel free to refresh to get additional recommended results!</li>
