ML Knit and Crochet Pattern Recommender using Ravelry API

Personal project created with @hannahfriedman during quarantine, summer 2020.  Inspired by Stitch Fix and similar style prediction algorithms, we designed a web application that allows users to vote on 20 random patterns fitting their specified qualifications, which then allows us to predict patterns that we think they'll enjoy.

This application was built using Python and Flask, and utilizes the Ravelry API for knit and crochet patterns.
